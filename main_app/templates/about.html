            <p >I love to dig into problems and solve them with modern technology. I can create, optimize and scale business processes that matter. To accomplish this, I focus on delivering key outcomes, building from feedback and quickly adapting to new learnings.My background screams diversity. Whether in pharmaceutical, food production or aerospace, my goal has always been to assess processes, analyze them, educate, digitize it and drive change across all functional areas.That’s how I quickly realized how enjoyable IT projects are. To dig deeper into this passion, I took a Business Analyst Diploma at HEC, and SAP (Terp10) on my own to be able to walk the talk. In my role across these industries, I have developed a problem-solving attitude, enhanced analytical thinking by wearing different hats on various projects. From requirement elicitation, facilitating meetings, to elaborate regulatory documentation and provide UAT support. I’ve seen a great deal of the SDLC. Whether when we reduced our deviations by 30% following adherence Health Canada standard by implementing an eDMS or when we successfully got our main quality process integrated to our ERP via SAP QM. I stand in amazement at how digital transformation turns caterpillars into butterflies. I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives.
